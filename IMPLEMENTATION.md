## Phase 3: YUTE Academy & Learning Platform

### Database Schema
Located in: `supabase/migrations/20250102000002_learning_platform.sql`

Tables created:
- `learning_paths` - Learning path definitions
- `courses` - Individual courses
- `user_course_progress` - User progress tracking
- `badges` - Achievement badges
- `user_badges` - User badge collection
- `user_xp` - User XP and level tracking

Seeded Data:
- 3 Learning paths (Rookie Investor, Side-Hustle Starter, Crypto Connoisseur)
- 6 Initial badges
- 24 Courses across all paths (see migration 20250102000003_seed_courses.sql)

### UI Components

#### 1. Academy Homepage (`/academy`)
Component: `src/pages/YuteAcademy.tsx`
Features:
- Display all published learning paths
- User XP and level display (if logged in)
- Streak tracking
- Tier-based badges (free, pro, elite)
- Difficulty indicators

#### 2. Learning Path Detail (`/academy/path/:pathId`)
Component: `src/pages/LearningPathDetail.tsx`
Features:
- Course curriculum display
- Progress tracking per course
- Overall path completion percentage
- Course metadata (duration, XP reward, type)
- Content type icons (video, audio, text, quiz, interactive)

#### 3. Course Player (`/academy/course/:courseId`)
Component: `src/pages/CoursePlayer.tsx`
Features:
- Course content display (placeholder for different content types)
- Progress tracking
- Course completion with XP rewards
- Automatic level calculation
- Navigation between courses

### Routes
- `/academy` - Academy homepage
- `/academy/path/:pathId` - Learning path detail
- `/academy/course/:courseId` - Course player (protected)

## TypeScript Types

All database types have been updated in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` to include:
- All new tables for Stokie Circles
- All new tables for Learning Platform
- Proper type safety for all database operations

## Navigation

Updated `src/components/Navigation.tsx` to include:
- Link to Stokie Circles
- Link to YUTE Academy
- Responsive mobile menu

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
Both phases implement comprehensive RLS policies:

**Stokie Circles:**
- Public circles viewable by everyone
- Private circles only viewable by members
- Only creators can update circles
- Members can join public circles
- Only circle members can view contributions, messages, and votes

**Learning Platform:**
- Published content viewable by all
- User progress only viewable/editable by the user
- XP leaderboard accessible to everyone
- Badges viewable by all

## User Experience Features

### Gamification
- XP rewards for course completion
- Level progression (100 XP per level)
- Badge system (6 initial badges)
- Streak tracking
- Leaderboard support (data structure ready)

### Progress Tracking
- Per-course progress percentage
- Overall learning path completion
- Visual progress bars
- Completion indicators

### Social Features
- Circle membership management
- Circle chat (read-only display)
- Transparent contribution ledger
- Member roles (creator, admin, member)

## What Was NOT Implemented (As Specified)

1. **Payment Integration** - Skipped as per requirements
2. **Real-time Chat Input** - Chat messages are displayed but input UI not implemented
3. **Voting Interface UI** - Database structure ready but UI not implemented
4. **Invite System** - Database structure ready but invite flow not implemented
5. **Badges Showcase Page** - Badges exist in DB but no dedicated showcase page
6. **Leaderboard Page** - Data structure ready but no dedicated page

## Future Enhancements

1. Add real-time chat messaging with Supabase Realtime
2. Implement voting interface for circle payouts
3. Add invite system for private circles
4. Create badges showcase page
5. Implement leaderboard page
6. Add actual video/audio players for course content
7. Implement interactive quiz functionality
8. Add payment integration when ready

## Technical Notes

### Build Status
- Project builds successfully with no errors
- All TypeScript types are properly defined
- Linting warnings are only in existing UI component files (not related to new features)

### Database Migrations
All migrations are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely) using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. All features use existing libraries:
- React Router for routing
- Supabase for database
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Existing authentication system

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run migrations in Supabase to create tables
2. Test circle creation and joining
3. Test course enrollment and completion
4. Verify XP and level calculations
5. Test access control for private circles
6. Verify RLS policies work correctly

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure Supabase environment variables are set
2. Run migrations in order:
   - 20250102000001_stokie_circles.sql
   - 20250102000002_learning_platform.sql
   - 20250102000003_seed_courses.sql
3. Deploy application as normal
4. No additional configuration needed
