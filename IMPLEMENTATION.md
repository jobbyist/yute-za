## Technical Notes

### Build Status
- Project builds successfully with no errors
- All TypeScript types are properly defined
- Linting warnings are only in existing UI component files (not related to new features)

### Database Migrations
All migrations are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely) using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. All features use existing libraries:
- React Router for routing
- Supabase for database
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Existing authentication system

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run migrations in Supabase to create tables
2. Test circle creation and joining
3. Test course enrollment and completion
4. Verify XP and level calculations
5. Test access control for private circles
6. Verify RLS policies work correctly

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure Supabase environment variables are set
2. Run migrations in order:
   - 20250102000001_stokie_circles.sql
   - 20250102000002_learning_platform.sql
   - 20250102000003_seed_courses.sql
3. Deploy application as normal
4. No additional configuration needed
